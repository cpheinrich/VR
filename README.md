# SF VR Hackathon 2016
- Code from the VR Hackathon in SF on December 3-4.
- We developed an application for Project Tango that measures length, width and height of some volume in the room from depth camera. The application then suggests furniture you can buy that fits within this volume of space. 
- Our team "Goldibox: Furniture Fitter" won first place in the category of "Best AR app". Judges for the competition were: Liv Erickson (Microsoft), Craig Cannon (Y Combinator) and Tom Emrich (Super Ventures).
